## Problem Statement
Assignment of a Digital Address Code (DAC) comprising geo-coordinates of the house (Latitude/Longitude) will ease locating addresses for the delivery of government services and other purposes. Digital Address is a unique, standard, and permanent identification of a physical address on a digital map having some sense of directionality and intuitiveness. The address needs to be differentiated from the addresses. DAC will also allow the authentication of addresses and the elimination of fake addresses, aiming to create a central database of addresses. The Hackathon team should design and implement the most efficient design, creation, and use of the DAC for the abovementioned purposes. Teams must take care of speed, accuracy, storage complexity, security, the DAC's flexibility, excluding sensitive locations, etc.
